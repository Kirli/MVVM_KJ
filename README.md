# MVVM - The Movie Database
This project connects to the movie database api see https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started/introduction for more details.

The api key used should be placed in key.properties there is a sample file key.properties.sample that can be copied and the value set.

## Technologies used:
### View Models, Live Data, Architecture Components
This is used for the MVVM architecture. You can do some reading about this at https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture. To learn more about how we use LiveData within ViewModels you can watch the following https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMcDk2_4LSk&t=4m16s .
### Navigation Architecture Component
Used to handle the navigation within the app https://developer.android.com/guide/navigation .
### Retrofit
Standard used for api calls.
### Dagger
Our dependency injection framework, their mostly unhelpful documentation resides here: https://google.github.io/dagger/ .
